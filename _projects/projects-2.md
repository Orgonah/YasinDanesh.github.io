This project implements an **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** model from scratch using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, and **Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss**. It is designed to read captchas with high accuracy metrics:

- **Train Accuracy**: 99.68%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 99.04%

The model effectively handles image loading, preprocessing, and augmentation, combining CNNs for feature extraction with RNNs for sequence prediction. A custom **CTC loss** function ensures efficient training by handling alignment between predicted and true sequences.
